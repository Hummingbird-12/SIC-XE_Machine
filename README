0. How to execute program

* After unzipping, there should be:
- 5 *.h header files        (20161577.h, cmdProc.h, shell.h, memory.h, hash.h)
- 5 *.c source code files   (20161577.c, cmdProc.c, shell.c, memory.c, hash.c)
- opcode.txt
- Makefile
- README

* Then, type the following to execute program:
$ make
$ ./20161577.out

* To cleanup directory after execution, type:
$ make clean


1. Description

This is the first project for the System Programmig course in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea.
It is a simple shell system made with C. You may play around with different commands available, have a look at how memory is managed by a system and learn about simple opcodes.


2. Specification

- Allocated virtual memory: 1 MB


3. Allowed Commands

- h[elp]                    : show list and format of commands.
- d[ir]                     : show list of entries in current directory.
- q[uit]                    : exit system.
- hi[story]                 : show list of valid commands entered during current session.
- du[mp] [start, end]       : print content of virtual memory.
- e[dit] address, value     : change value at designated memory address.
- f[ill] start, end, value  : batch fill an interval in address with a value.
- reset                     : set whole memory to 0x00.
- opcode mnemonic           : lookup for the code of the opcode mnemonic.
- opcodelist                : show opcode list stored in hash table.


4. Other information

This system will further be improved with more features such as assembler, etc.
